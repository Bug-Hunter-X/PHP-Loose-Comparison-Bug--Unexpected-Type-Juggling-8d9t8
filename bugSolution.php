The solution involves using the strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of the loose comparison operator (`==`). The strict comparison operator checks for both value and type equality.

```php
<?php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Loose comparison: a equals b\n";
}
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: a equals b\n";
}
?>
```

By using `===`, the code will only evaluate to true if both the value and type of `$a` and `$b` are identical. This prevents the unexpected behavior caused by type juggling.
