This code exhibits a subtle error related to PHP's type juggling and comparison operators. The `==` operator performs loose comparison, while `===` performs strict comparison.  In the example below, the loose comparison (`==`) unexpectedly evaluates to true even though the types differ. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs if not properly handled.

```php
<?php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Loose comparison: a equals b\n";
}
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: a equals b\n";
} 
?>
```
